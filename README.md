# MyReads Project

>This project is a part of [Udacity's](https://github.com/udacity) React Nano Degree (All rights belong to Udacity). You can find books and track them. You can add them to different shelves according to the task being performed. Project is created with react.

## Dependencies

* react
* react-router-dom
* prop-types
* Any other can be found in the [package.json](package.json)

## Want to check this app out?

* clone this repository in any directory(or it can be downloaded in form of a zip file).
* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`

## Important
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.
